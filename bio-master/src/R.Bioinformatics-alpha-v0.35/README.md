# R.Bioinformatics
R language bioinformatics analysis package wrapper for VisualBasic.

This project is aim at provides a high performance distribution and parallel computing environment for bioinformatics data analysis of VisualBasic hybrid programming with R.


Folks from project:
R.NET   [https://rdotnet.codeplex.com/](https://rdotnet.codeplex.com/)
and 
VisualBasic Parallel Computing Framework
[https://github.com/xieguigang/Microsoft.VisualBasic.Parallel](https://github.com/xieguigang/Microsoft.VisualBasic.Parallel)

Currently there is a bioconductor GUI installer was included in this project for those beginners in the area of bioinformatics and some of the common used R package wrapper class which written in VisualBasic was developed to extends the biological data analysis ability of GCModeller and Microsoft .NET languages.
