The Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus. AcMNPV is an insect virus belonging to the Alphabaculovirus genus of Baculoviridae family. The AcMNPV is a double-stranded DNA virus with a 133 kilobase pair (kbp)-long circular genome encompassing 156 open reading frames (ORFs). The viral genes are closely-spaced, 48 adjacent genes overlap with each other. Previous studies of the AcMNPV transcriptome using microarray [28] and real-time PCR [29] analysis focused mainly on the expression dynamics, while a study using 5’ and 3’ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 5’ capped RNA sequencing on Illumina short-read sequencing platform described many of the potential TSSs and TESs. Inspite of the high precision of these methods, they are unable to uncover the transcriptome complexity AcMNPV in its entirety, they especially in the identification of polycistronic RNA molecules and transcript isoforms. Here, we present a large RNA-Seq dataset, derived from  long-read sequencing using Oxford Nanopore’s MinION device with direct RNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing methods.
